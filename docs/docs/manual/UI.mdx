XR Blocks includes a 2D UI toolkit to create 2D UI elements in a panel within the scene.

## View

The [`View`](/api/classes/View) class extends the [`Script`](/api/classes/Script) class with utilities methods to facilities rendering 2D UI:

1. Relative positioning and sizing
2. Setting the render order based on the scene graph depth

### Relative positioning and sizing.

Object extending the view class are positioned and sized relative to their parent. \

1. `x` and `y` set the relative position the view where `-0.5` and `0.5` represent the left and right edges of the parent view.
2. `width` and `height` set the relative size of the view where `1.0` represents the full width or height of the parent view.

The `updateLayout()` function applies the relative position to the `position` and `scale` properties of the view and computes a new `aspectRatio` property based on the parent view.
It is automatically called when the view is added to another view or when `updateLayoutsBFS` is called from any parent view.

Child classes may override `updateLayout` to respond to changes in position or scale.

### Coordinate system

The coordinate system within a view is uniformely scaled such that the origin `(0, 0, 0)` represents the center of the view and the range `[-0.5,0.5] x [-0.5,0.5]` represents the largest square which fits within the view.
View objects provide a `aspectRatio` property which provides a true ratio of width over height.

As a helper utility, each view provides two getter properties, `rangeX` and `rangeY`, which provide the height and width of the view within it's own coordinate system based on the aspect ratio.
For example, a landscape view with a `16:9` aspect ratio will have a `rangeX == 16/9` and a `rangeY == 1`.

## Available Views

The following views are provided as initial building blocks:

### Panel

The `Panel` class provides a root view with a rounded rectangle mesh to serve as a background. It also positions itself in front of the user by default.

For example:

```js
const panel = new xb.Panel({
  width: 1.0,
  height: 1.0,
  backgroundColor: '#00000000',
  useDefaultPosition: true,
});
```

### Spatial Panel

A `SpatialPanel` is a draggable version of the `Panel` class.

For example:

```js
const panel = new xb.SpatialPanel({
  backgroundColor: '#00000000',
  useDefaultPosition: true,
  showEdge: true,
});
```

### Grid View

The `GridView` class allows splitting up a view into multiple sections.

### Image View

The `ImageView` class displays a image from a URL.

### Text View

The `TextView` class adds text using the [`troika-three-text` library](https://github.com/protectwise/troika).

### Horizontal and Vertical Pagers

The `HorizontalPager` and `VerticalPager` classes provide scrolling pages to your views.

They can be combined with the following additional classes:

- `PagerState` which holds the current page and automatically scrolls to the nearest page.
- `PageIndicator` adds a small page indicator ◦◦•◦◦ based on the pager state.

### Scrolling Text View

The `ScrollingTroikaTextView` class provides a text view where the text moves upwards out of the view when a new line is added.
