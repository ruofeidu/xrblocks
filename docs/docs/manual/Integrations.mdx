XR Blocks is designed to be modular and lightweight. Many features are enabled only when specific optional dependencies are installed in your project. This approach allows you to keep your bundle size small by including only the features you need.

## Optional Dependencies

The following table lists the optional dependencies supported by XR Blocks and the features they unlock.

| Feature                    | Dependency                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physics**                | [`@dimforge/rapier3d`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dimforge/rapier3d) | Enables physics simulation for 3D objects, including rigid body dynamics, colliders, and gravity. Required for any physics-based interactions. |
| **Generative AI (Gemini)** | [`@google/genai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/genai)           | Enables integration with Google's Gemini models, including Multimodal Live API support for real-time audio/video interaction.                  |
| **Generative AI (OpenAI)** | [`openai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai)                         | Enables integration with OpenAI's models for text generation and chat capabilities.                                                            |
